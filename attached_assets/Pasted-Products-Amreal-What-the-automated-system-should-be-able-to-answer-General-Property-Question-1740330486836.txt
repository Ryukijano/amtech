These are the 70 questions that should be asked on the real estate chatbot. Make sure when designing the automated system that it can adapt to each business so say for an example if a customer asks their chatbot what does it sell but it does not actually sell then it should reply by selling they don’t sell houses once it is attached to the real estate agencies data. Make sure there is also a multi-language model attached. Make sure like chat GPT the estate agent can add some general questions that pops up and he can also turn on and off these questions for showing.
